    <p> DeBose made her television debut in 2009, when she competed on the TV series <b>So You Think You Can Dance</b>, making it into the Top 20. She later appeared on the soap opera <b>One Life to Live</b> and played Inez in the North Carolina Theatre's production of <b>Hairspray</b> before appearing in the role of Nautica in the 2011 Alliance Theatre production of <b>Bring It On</b>. She also appeared in the ensemble of the New York Philharmonic production of <b>Company</b>, which was filmed for television. At the end of 2011, Bring It On embarked on a national tour across the United States. DeBose continued her role into the 2012 Broadway production and understudied the character Danielle.
        In 2013, DeBose played Mary Wilson in <b>Motown</b> on Broadway, understudying the role of Diana Ross. She later joined the cast of <b>Pippin</b> on Broadway, playing a noble and a player and understudying the role of the Leading Player, which she ended up taking over for a short period in 2014. She can be heard playing director/choreographer Zoey Taylor in <b>As the Curtain Rises</b>, an original Broadway soap opera podcast from the Broadway Podcast Network.
        In 2015, DeBose left Pippin to join the ensemble of the off-Broadway musical <b>Hamilton</b>. The show moved to Broadway later that year. She left Hamilton in July 2016 and made a guest appearance on the TV series <b>Blue Bloods</b> as Sophia Ortiz. She also starred as Daphne in the thriller film <b>Seaside</b>. From November 2016 to August 2017, DeBose portrayed Jane on Broadway in <b>A Bronx Tale</b>. 

    <p> DeBose played Alyssa Greene in the film adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prom_(musical)"><b>The Prom</b></a>, directed by Ryan Murphy. In March 2021, DeBose released a dance-pop recording and video of Rodgers & Hammerstein's "Shall We Dance" for the album R&H Goes Pop, produced by Justin Goldner and arranged by Benjamin Rauhala. In 2021, DeBose played Emma Tate in the parody musical comedy series <b>Schmigadoon!</b> on Apple TV+. She will also star in the spy film <b>Argylle</b> for the service. Despite initially not seeing herself playing the role and refusing to audition for it, DeBose played Anita in the 2021 film adaptation of the musical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoQEddtFN3Q"><b>West Side Story</b></a>, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film was released in December 2021 to critical acclaim. DeBose herself received critical attention for her performance of Anita, with Caryn James of BBC praising her performance, declaring, "Anita, in a layered, dynamic performance by Ariana DeBose, is the centre of attention, swirling her skirt and dancing to the Latin rhythms that infuse the film." David Fear of Rolling Stone wrote, "DeBose...strong contender for Most Valuable Player here, whose energy—in her singing, her dancing, her line-reading, her side-eyeing—could power a metropolitan block." She also received multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, a Critics' Choice Movie Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award, making her the first Afro-Latina and queer woman of color to win the latter award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
